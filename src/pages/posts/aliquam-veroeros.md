I have managed SEO for major business in Tucson, Arizona. I report on online advertising and web traffic metrics, and use analytical findings to meet both client and company goals. For example, I implemented a $6,000.00 per month digital marketing strategies which generates $300,000.00 per year in e-commerce sales for a Tucson client. My experience in lead nurturing has also generated over 800 quality leads, returning $250,000.00 per year in incremental revenue for another Tucson business.
